## Summary
I implemented the backend and frontend for the update and delete endpoints. 

For the frontend, they are seen `Planes.vue` as buttons and will communicate with the api endpoints via the `planesServices.js`. 

For the backend, my implementation can be seen in `backend/main.js` and `backend/server/helpers`.
